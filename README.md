Funny recursive pictures written in Python 2 using Pygame module

####   interactive_julia_set.py
You can explore Julia set for different parameters by moving mouse over Mandelbrot set. 
Bright parts of the last one are values of parameter C, for which Julia stays connected.

Rendering is very slow. I used escape time algorithm with some modifications for faster color calculation.

####   tree.py
It's almost classical Pythagoras tree but with slightly different proportions. 
Right angle between two adjacent branches of the same level is preserved.

####   apollonian_gasket.py
..I still can't figure out how to write it in Python, but I can draw it with a pen!
